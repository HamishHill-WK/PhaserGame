            <p>Thank you for participating in this research on AI-assisted learning!</p>
            
            <p>This study explores how effectively Large Language Model (LLM) AI assistants can support users with different levels of expertise in completing game development tasks. We're investigating how AI tools can enhance learning and productivity across various skill levels.</p>
                
            <p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: those with AI assistant access and those working independently. This allows us to understand how AI assistance impacts the learning process and task completion for users with varying backgrounds.</p>
            
            <p>Your contributions help us evaluate how well AI can adapt to support both newcomers and experienced developers. The code you created and your interactions with the system provide valuable insights into how AI assistants can be designed to better support learning and skill development.</p>
                
            <p>Your survey responses help us understand how AI assistance effectiveness varies across different expertise levels, contributing to the development of more effective AI learning tools.</p>
            
            <p>All data is anonymized and will be used solely for research purposes to advance our understanding of human-AI collaboration in learning environments.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for your valuable contribution to this research! Your participation helps us create better AI tools that can support learners and developers more effectively.</p>
